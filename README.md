# ExifLensHelper
An Applescript helper to quickly modify EXIF data

This script is inteded to quickly modify EXIF data of the selected images in Finder using [exiftool](https://exiftool.org).
I had the necessity to only change the lens model, but the script can be easily adapted to apply any change you want.

I reccomend to save the script as an application your Mac. Then, while holding down the command key, drag the app to the Finder bar.
You will end up with something like this:

You can now select the images you want to modify in the Finder and then directly click on the icon.

After that you can choose which preset to apply to the images.

ExifLensHelper will take care of the rest.
